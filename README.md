## 🚀 About Me

I build **end-to-end data science and machine learning systems** — from raw data and feature engineering to **validated models, explainable insights, and production-ready pipelines**.

My experience spans **sales forecasting, healthcare ML, federated learning research, and AI agent systems**, with a strong focus on **model quality, robustness, and real-world impact**.

---

## 🔬 What I Work On
- 📈 Time-series forecasting & demand modeling  
- 🤖 Applied machine learning with rigorous evaluation  
- 🧠 LLM-powered systems with structured outputs & safeguards  
- 🏗️ End-to-end ML pipelines (data → model → insights → deployment)

---

## 💼 Experience Snapshot
- **Data Science Co-Op (Sales Forecasting)** – Industry project improving LSTM-based forecasting pipelines  
- **Data Scientist Intern (Healthcare ML)** – Built AWS-deployed risk models on 500K+ clinical records, reducing manual effort by 40%  
- **Data Analyst Intern** – Supply-chain analytics and dashboards translating data into operations decisions

## 🚀 Featured Projects
🔹 **AI-Powered Job Search Automation**  
LLM-based system that extracts job requirements, performs structured gap analysis, and generates **0–100 match scores across 400+ roles**, reducing application prep time by **70%**.

🔹 **TrustWeight: Asynchronous Federated Learning**  
Proposed a trust-based staleness control mechanism, improving accuracy to **52–53% vs. 11–28% baselines** under non-IID and delayed-client settings.

🔹 **UK Real Estate Predictive Analytics Platform**  
Processed **25M+ transactions**, trained ensemble models (R² = 0.87), and delivered SHAP-based explainability via interactive dashboards.

🔹 **Crypto Market Analysis Agent**  
Built a tool-using AI agent that combines live market data and news with reliability safeguards and automated testing.

👉 Each project repo includes problem framing, methodology, evaluation, and results.
